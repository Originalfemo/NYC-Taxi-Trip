# NYC-Taxi-Trip
This dataset focuses on Exploring and visualizing a NYC taxi trip duration dataset. This analysis focuses on exploring and questioning the data, cleaning, working through the data to remove outliers and anomalies, generating new data from already existing data for further analysis, and visualization

It is important to note that due to the use of plotly library for visualization, some viz will not show directly on github here. There will be a need to run the codes again so the viz can come up
